**Simple goldenfile testing in Rust.**

[Goldenfile](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/358786/what-is-golden-files) tests generate one or more output files as they run. At the end of the test, the generated files are compared to checked-in "golden" files produced by previous runs. This ensures that all changes to goldenfiles are intentional, explicit, and version controlled.

You can use goldenfiles to test the output of a parser, the order of a graph traversal, the result of a simulation, or anything else that shouldn't change without a human's approval.

## Usage

```rust
extern crate goldenfile;

use std::io::Write;

use goldenfile::Mint;

#[test]
fn test() {
    let mut mint = Mint::new("tests/goldenfiles");
    let mut file1 = mint.new_goldenfile("file1.txt").unwrap();
    let mut file2 = mint.new_goldenfile("file2.txt").unwrap();

    write!(file1, "Hello ").unwrap();
    write!(file1, "World!").unwrap();
    write!(file2, "Foo").unwrap();
    write!(file2, "Bar").unwrap();

    // When the Mint goes out of scope, it will check the new contents of file1
    // and file2 against their version controlled "golden" contents and fail the
    // test if they differ.
    //
    // To update the goldenfiles themselves, run:
    //
    //     REGENERATE_GOLDENFILES=1 cargo test
    //
}
```
